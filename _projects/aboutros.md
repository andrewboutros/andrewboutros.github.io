### Bio

Andrew Boutros is an incoming Assistant Professor in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department at the University of Waterloo. His research aims to build more efficient reconfigurable computing hardware that is easier and faster to program. His interests include architecture and CAD for FPGAs and new forms of reconfigurable hardware and deep learning hardware systems.

Andrew received his BSc in Electronics Engineering from the German University in Cairo, and his MASc and PhD from the University of Toronto. During and before his PhD, Andrew was a researcher at Intel Labs and Intel's Programmable Solutions Group (now Altera). He also spent two years at MangoBoost, a startup developing data processing units for accelerating datacenter infrastructure, where he established and led their Toronto office before joining the University of Waterloo. His work received 4 best paper awards and 3 more nominations from top conferences in the field of reconfigurable hardware.

### On a Personal Note

I am an Egyptian currently living in Canada. I studied and worked in 3 continents and 4 different countries since my undergrad. I am a father of a beautiful daughter, *Ayla*, and a husband to a loving wife, *Sarah*. If you wrote a paper with me or asked my feedback about presentations before, you would know that I am borderline OCD when it comes to figures and organization -- if this gets on your nerves, sorry for that :)

I am not very big on physical activities and I find enjoyment in only a few things in life outside work including reading historical fictions, watching soccer, and playing chess (eventhough I am not good at it!).

### Academic Family

Attempting to work up the tree of my academic family was quite interesting! Thanks to the [Mathematics Genealogy Project](https://mathgenealogy.org/index.php) and Sergey Gribok for the help with this random endeavor.
