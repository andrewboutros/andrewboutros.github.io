My research aims to build new reconfigurable computing architectures that are more efficient, easier and faster to program, and better suited for key workloads at the edge and datacenters. This involves work on circuit and architecture modeling, computer-aided design tools, and application/hardware co-design.</p> <p>Before joining the University of Waterloo, I received my PhD in Computer Engineering from the University of Toronto, where I was lucky to be trained by <a href="https://www.eecg.utoronto.ca/~vaughn/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Prof. Vaughn Betz</a>. During and before my PhD, I was a researcher at Intel Labs and Intelâ€™s Programmable Solutions Group (now Altera). Then, I established and led the Toronto office of <a href="https://www.mangoboost.io/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">MangoBoost</a>, a Seattle-based startup developing data processing units for datacenter infrastructure acceleration.</p> </body></html>
