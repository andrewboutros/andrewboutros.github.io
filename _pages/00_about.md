I am an incoming Assistant Professor at the department of [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://uwaterloo.ca/electrical-computer-engineering/) of the [University of Waterloo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Waterloo) starting in January 2025.
My research focuses on building new reconfigurable computing architectures that are more efficient, easier and faster to program, and better suited for high-demand workloads at the edge and datacenters.
This involves work on architecture and circuit modeling, computer-aided design tools, and application/hardware co-design.
I am particularly interested in applications from the deep learning and datacenter networking domains.

Before joining the University of Waterloo, I received my PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Toronto, where I was lucky to be trained by [Prof. Vaughn Betz](https://www.eecg.utoronto.ca/~vaughn/).
During and before my PhD, I was a researcher at Intel Labs and Intel's Programmable Solutions Group (now Altera).
Then, I established and led the Toronto office of [MangoBoost](https://www.mangoboost.io/), a Seattle-based startup developing data processing units for datacenter infrastructure acceleration.

### Research Interests

- Efficient hardware acceleration of key **applications** (such as deep learning and networking) using FPGAs and other reconfigurable architectures.
- **Architecture** of future FPGAs and beyond-FPGA reconfigurable acceleration devices that integrate traditional programmable fabrics with coarse-grained accelerators and networks-on-chip.
- Applying machine learning techniques in FPGA **computer-aided design** tools for faster runtime and higher quality of results.
