  contents: >
    I am a final-year PhD student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at 
    the University of Toronto under the supervision of Prof. Vaughn Betz. My research interests 
    are the intersection of FPGA architecture/CAD and deep learning acceleration. 
    I am an affiliate of the Intel/VMware Crossroads 3D-FPGA Academic Research Center, 
    the Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence, and the International Centre for Spatial 
    Computational Learning. I also work at MangoBoost, a rapidly growing startup that develops 
    data processing units for accelerating datacenter infrastructure operations. From 2018 to 2022, 
    I was a research scientist at Intel Labs and Intel's Programmable Solutions Group CTO Office. 
    I received my MASc in Computer Engineering from the University of Toronto in 2018, and my BSc 
    in Electronics Engineering from the German University in Cairo in 2016.
